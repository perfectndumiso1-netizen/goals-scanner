# ⚽ PlayReport

Automatic football analysis that runs **every 30 minutes** on GitHub Actions and publishes to the PlayReport
Android app and Telegram — no servers, no API keys, and it runs while your phone is in your pocket.

* **Coverage** — every competition on the public live feed, worldwide (including women's and youth leagues),
  priced by Sportybet South Africa; the 22 main European leagues additionally get corners, cards and referee models.
* **Data-first model** — every probability comes from football data only (goals, form, venue, league baseline →
  Dixon-Coles score matrix); bookmaker prices are a *separate comparison layer* (implied %, difference, EV, market xG)
  and never feed the model. Every statistic carries its sample size (Very small 1–4 … Very strong 40+), every match
  has a transparent data-quality assessment, the raw matches used, extreme results flagged and the model's own
  numbers ("why 1.35 goals?") in the app's **Data** tab and in `python audit.py HOME AWAY`. Missing data is N/A, never 0.
* **Goals shortlists** — Over 1.5, Over 2.5, Both Teams To Score, from the backtested and calibrated model.
* **High-probability selections** — singles with model probability ≥ 70 % (the de-margined Sportybet price must not
  contradict it), price ≥ 1.30, in the goals / BTTS / team-goals / corners / cards markets. New ones are announced
  immediately (Telegram + app). Nothing is ever labelled "safe" or "guaranteed".
* **⭐ Bets of the day** — grouped card, strong on Over 1.5 & team goals; 1X2 / BTTS / Over 2.5 only with strong supporting form; one market per match; graded separately.
* **Trends, head-to-head and home/away form** on every match page; live scores, line-ups and match statistics for
  every match in play; squad values (Transfermarkt) for the main leagues.
* **Live research & context** (Phase A: collected and shown, **not yet weighted**) — for the fixtures inside the
  published window the scanner also records attributed current information: confirmed line-ups from the live feed
  when they are published, reported team news (outlet, link and publication time, availability signals flagged but
  never "verified"), scheduling/fatigue from our own archive, the competition format, and Open-Meteo weather for
  genuinely severe conditions only. Each match shows **base probability → context → final probability** with a
  research-quality grade (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/INSUFFICIENT), the reasons, the sources and any unresolved conflict;
  missing information is N/A and normal weather is no adjustment by rule. With the shipped configuration the
  published probability is *identical* to the statistical model — see `docs/RESEARCH.md`.
* **Bet slip & tickets** in the app — build a multiple from priced selections, lock it, and PlayReport grades it from
  the scores and match statistics (private record on the phone).
* **Results archive** — every finished match on the live feed is kept with half-time score, corners, cards, shots and
  possession (`data/ls/` on the data branch), feeding the corners / cards models for every league over time.
* **Checked before publishing** — every run exports the app data to a staging directory and `verify.py` checks it
  (format, probabilities, prices, selection rules, day-card sections, detail files, evidence layer, no market
  contamination of model probabilities, ledger integrity) before it is
  promoted; a failed check keeps the previous publication and reports the problem on Telegram.
* **Season backfill** — up to two earlier seasons of every covered competition are archived from Livescore once,
  so head-to-head, form and league pages are complete outside football-data's leagues.
* **Delivery** — full report (Markdown + PDF) at 07:00 / 12:00 / 17:00 SAST on Telegram; app data on the `data`
  branch (`data/app/latest.json`, per-match files, 60-day history); a weekly performance digest on Mondays.

The code lives on `main`; all generated state (reports, ledgers, app data, the Livescore archive) lives on the
orphan `data` branch, which is force-pushed by every run so the history stays small.

Statistical information, not betting advice. 18+.

## 🎾 Tennis Scanner (separate module)

`tennis/` is an independent package built beside the football scanner — own data (`data/tennis/`, `data/app/tennis/`
on the orphan `tennis-data` branch), own model, tracker (`data/tennis/tracker.csv`), reports (`reports/tennis/`),
workflow (`.github/workflows/tennis-scan.yml`, four runs a day) and tests (`tennis/tests/`). It imports nothing from
the football model code; the only shared piece is the generic Markdown → PDF helper. See `docs/TENNIS_AUDIT.md`
(architecture, sources, limitations) and `tennis/BACKTEST_RESULTS.md` (walk-forward validation and calibration).

* **Coverage** — ATP / WTA main tours and ATP/WTA Challengers, singles only (no ITF, team events or doubles).
* **Data** — Jeff Sackmann's historical match files (tennisabstract.com, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, June 2026 snapshot via the
  Aneeshers archive mirror; 288,040 matches 2005–2026) for ratings, form, serve/return statistics; Livescore for
  results after the snapshot (no statistics — serve/return traits from the archive are marked stale when old);
  Sportybet prices as a *comparison layer only*. Anything missing is N/A, never zero.
* **Model** — Elo (overall + surface blend, sample-size K schedule) → set probability → explicit best-of-3 / best-of-5
  match probability (2-0 / 2-1 / 3-0 / 3-1 / 3-2 each way) → Markov point/game chain for total games, player games
  and game handicap. Parameters chosen on 2012–2018, evaluated on 2019–2026 (walk-forward, no look-ahead).
* **Output** — per match: MODEL PROBABILITY, FAIR ODDS, BOOKMAKER ODDS, MARKET IMPLIED, EDGE and DATA QUALITY
  (a 14-check score of the evidence, not a win probability). Reports at 08:00 / 18:00 SAST on Telegram labelled
  "🎾 TENNIS SCANNER". No parlays, no tennis + football combinations.
* **Selections of the day** — one preferred market per match (`tennis/markets.py::select`): the highest model
  probability ≥ 60 % among Sportybet-priced markets (price ≥ 1.30) whose margin-free implied probability is ≥ 45 %
  (the market must not contradict the pick), data quality ≥ 60, both players ≥ 30 rated matches, no low-confidence
  game data, model − market ≤ 20 pp. **Strong** = model ≥ 70 % and market ≥ 50 %. Ranked by probability, never by
  edge. Grouped by market (Match winner / Total games / Player games / Game handicap) in `latest.json`
  (`selections`, `sections`, `strong`), the reports and Telegram.
* **Tracker** — `data/tennis/tracker.csv` grades four groups separately (`kind` = day / strong / highlight /
  favourite): hit rate vs average model probability and flat-stake units at the recorded price. Day files
  `data/app/tennis/days/<day>.json` keep every analysed match with its result and settlement; `days/index.json` lists them.
* **App** — sport switch (⚽ Football | 🎾 Tennis) at the top of every tab in `tennis.js`; the football views are
  wrapped, not modified. Tennis Home / Bets / Live / Matches / Days and a match page with Overview / Markets /
  Stats / Data (sample labels, last 10 matches with raw scores, H2H context only, quality checks, identity, inputs).
  Smoke test: `android/tennis_ui_test.py`.
